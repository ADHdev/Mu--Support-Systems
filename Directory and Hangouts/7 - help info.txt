                              THE DIRECTORY SYSTEM
 
dir                                                                     
    List all populated locations.
dir/all                                                                 
    List all locations.
dir <name>
    List details about location <name>, which may be partially typed.
dir/who <name>                                                          
    Lists details and who's there, if they are findable.
 
"Population" depends on who you can see normally. It does not hide 'unfindable'
people or rooms. The directory system is intended to find role-play and 
facilitate the setting.
 
Some locations will have a "view lock" which will prevent some people from 
seeing that location or getting details about it. Staff always pass this lock.
 
* Planned: personal location lists, "hangouts"

                          DIRECTORY: BUILDER COMMANDS
 
The key concept here is that one location may be made up of many rooms. One room 
must be the primary.
 
After each command description is a shortcut for when you're already in the room 
you want to add.
 
dir/create <room dbref>=<location name>
    Create a new location based on the a room.
    Shortcut: dir/create %L=New Location Name
 
dir/room <location name>=<room dbref>
    Add a new room to the list of rooms in that location.
    Shortcut: dir/room New Location Name=%L
 
dir/set <location name>/<element>=<value>
    Set <element>. Elements are:
    * Name (already set, but can be changed here)
    * Type
    * Availability (in game-terms, the cash needed to go here)
    * Owner (name of the PC or NPC owner; will be changing sometime)
    * Lock (view lock, uses %0 as the viewer)
    Shortcut: There is no shortcut for this.
 
&short-desc <main room dbref>=<a description of the location>           
    Give people an idea about what that location is for.                    
 
The system also pulls the map location of the main room from the main room. It 
will complain if it hasn't been set.

HELP: Basic Help

&help~commands~+hangouts #270=Finding People, Being Found~

[ljust(+hangouts, 23)] -- List hangouts with people in them
[ljust(+hangouts/all, 23)] -- List all hangouts
[ljust(+hangout <hangout name>, 23)] -- Look into a hangout

You can type the first part of the hangout name and the system will do its best to find your match.

The dbref of a room in a hangout will be visible if it is jump_ok or you are staff.

The population of a hangout or a room is listed regardless of the findability of the people or the room.  It will not list dark staff.

For this command, +hangout and +hangouts are synonymous in all uses.

SHELP: How To Make This Work

&shelp~commands~+hangouts #270=Setting Up Hangouts~

Expands: +help +hangouts

+hangout/add <main dbref>=<hangout name>/<map loc>%[/<description>%]

<main dbref>: Each hangout relies upon a main room dbref to treat as the main room.  If the main dbref is jump_ok, the hangout is marked as jump_ok.  If the main dbref is a nightzone, the hangout is marked as a nightzone.

<hangout name>: The name as will appear in +hangouts.

<map loc>: A three-letter location of where the hangout can be found on the map.

<description>: A short description of the hangout, shown in +hangout <name>.

+hangout/add also allows you to edit a hangout.  If the <main dbref> already exists, the rest of the information you add will overwrite the existing hangout information.  This way, you can change a hangout's name, map location, or description.

WARNING: If you're using +hangout/add to edit, you must enter all the information or that information will be erased.
~
+hangout/delete <main dbref>

Completely removes a hangout and all attached rooms from the hangouts list.  The only way to change a hangout's <main dbref> is to delete it and add it with a new dbref, and re-add any attached rooms.

[ansi(c, repeat(-, 74))]

+hangout/addroom <main dbref|hangout name>=%[!%]<room dbref>

While the <main dbref> is always part of a hangout's room list, you can add other rooms to it with this command.

The optional ! symbol, meaning "not", is how you remove a room from this list.  You can't remove the <main dbref>.

e.g.:
 %b +hangout/add #666=#254
 %b +hangout/add devil's cafe=!#254
