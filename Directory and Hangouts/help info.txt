SHELP: How To Make This Work

&shelp~commands~+hangouts #270=Setting Up Hangouts~

Expands: +help +hangouts

+hangout/add <main dbref>=<hangout name>/<map loc>%[/<description>%]

<main dbref>: Each hangout relies upon a main room dbref to treat as the main room.  If the main dbref is jump_ok, the hangout is marked as jump_ok.  If the main dbref is a nightzone, the hangout is marked as a nightzone.

<hangout name>: The name as will appear in +hangouts.

<map loc>: A three-letter location of where the hangout can be found on the map.

<description>: A short description of the hangout, shown in +hangout <name>.

+hangout/add also allows you to edit a hangout.  If the <main dbref> already exists, the rest of the information you add will overwrite the existing hangout information.  This way, you can change a hangout's name, map location, or description.

WARNING: If you're using +hangout/add to edit, you must enter all the information or that information will be erased.
~
+hangout/delete <main dbref>

Completely removes a hangout and all attached rooms from the hangouts list.  The only way to change a hangout's <main dbref> is to delete it and add it with a new dbref, and re-add any attached rooms.

[ansi(c, repeat(-, 74))]

+hangout/addroom <main dbref|hangout name>=%[!%]<room dbref>

While the <main dbref> is always part of a hangout's room list, you can add other rooms to it with this command.

The optional ! symbol, meaning "not", is how you remove a room from this list.  You can't remove the <main dbref>.

e.g.:
 %b +hangout/add #666=#254
 %b +hangout/add devil's cafe=!#254
