+ NOTES: An Awesome System

PEOPLE LOVE:
	Different view levels
	Let people edit notes, but the validation falls off - using CHOWN attribute
	Timestamp: creation, edit, lock

FORMAT:
	+note[/list/of/switches] <note>[=<other>]

KEY: 
	<note> - <object>/<note>

COMMANDS:

All switches are mutually exclusive unless noted otherwise.  Ignore all mutually exclusive switches except the first, in those cases.

@@ basics (approval falls off using any of these): 
	/new
	/add - adds to a note (appends)
	/edit <note>=<old>/<new>
	/replace
		Uses /add, except note must exist
	/delete

@@ moving (approval falls off using any of these): 
	/move <note>=<target>|<new name>|<target>/<new name>
	/clone <note>=<target>|<new name>|<target>/<new name>

@@ locks (stacks with basics and moving, except /delete):
	/apporove
	/lock
		Also /approves

@@ viewing:
	/view <item>|<note>|<item/note>
		+view: view here
		+view <item>: view item (processed first)
		+view <note>: view here/note
	/show <note>=<targets>

@@ permissions:
	/permissions <note>[=<permission level>]
		view, public
		note, private
		judgenote, staff
		(other use Access System Fob)

		Aliases chould assume permissions level.  e.g.:
			+view/new - public
			+note/new - private
			+judgenote/new - staff


-- SQL Notes -------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a full history system, a la Wikipedia.

(using 'thereach' as base-line game name)

SQL DD:
	Notes_ID (primary key)
	editor's dbref (primary key)
	timestamp (primary key)
	target'd debref (not null, to validate vs game dbref + _notes_ID)
	the complete new note, even if only edited (not null)
	permissions (default: private)
	approval dbref
	approval notes

--

CREATE TABLE thereach_notes
(
	notes_id	INT				NOT NULL, 
	editor		INT				NOT NULL, 
	time		TIMESTAMP		NOT NULL, 
	target		INT				NOT NULL, 
	note		TEXT			NOT NULL, 
	permission	VARCHAR(255)	DEFAULT 'private', 
	approver	INT, 
	appr_note	TEXT, 

	PRIMARY KEY (notes_id, editor, time)
);

--

// SQL record of a target's notes_id
SELECT DISTINCT (notes_id) FROM thereach_notes WHERE target = '[rest(<dbref>, #)]';

--

// Highest notes_id
SELECT DISTINCT (notes_id) FROM thereach_notes ORDER BY notes_id DESC LIMIT 1;
