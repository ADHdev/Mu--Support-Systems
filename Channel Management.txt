COMSYS COMMANDS AND FUNCTIONS

  These are the topics for the MUX comsystem:

  User Commands:            @clist, addcom, alias, allcom, comlist, comtitle,
                            clearcom, delcom

  Administrative Commands:  @cboot, @ccharge, @cchown, @ccreate, @cdestroy,
                            @cemit, @clist, @coflags, @cpflags, @cset, @cwho

  Functions:                channels(), chanobj(), comalias(), comtitle(),
                            cwho()

  General Information:      channel object, comsys examples


--

@CCREATE

  COMMAND: @ccreate <channel name>

  Only Wizards can create new channels.

  Creates a new channel with default settings. Once the channel is created,
  it can be associated with a object with the @cset command. That object can
  be used to set locks and descriptions on the channel.

  Example:
    > @ccreate Public
    Channel Public created.

  Related Topics: comsys, @cset, @cdestroy, @clist, @cchown.

@CDESTROY

  COMMAND: @cdestroy <channel>

  Deletes <channel> permanently from the comsystem database. It does not
  destroy all aliases that exist for <channel> -- those are left to the
  owners of those aliases. Players are notified both at login when they
  own aliases for which a channel no longer exists and when they try to
  use them. Even if a Channel is destroyed and then recreated, the alias
  will still be non functioning. The alias must be removed with the
  'delcom' command and added with the 'addcom' command.

  Example:
    > @cdestroy Staff
    Channel Staff destroyed.

  Related Topics: @clist, @ccreate, @cchown, addcom, delcom.

CHANNEL OBJECT

  In the comsystem, you may specify a channel object for each channel.
  (@cset/object channel=<object>). See 'help @cset' for help.

  Channel objects allow you to specify a description for a channel and
  place certain restrictions on joining, transmitting, and receiving.  If
  present on the channel object, the @comjoin, @comleave, @comon, and @comoff
  messages are evaluated and then sent to members performing the join, leave,
  on, and off actions, respectively.

  NOTE: If a channel flag is set by @cpflags or @coflags, those will ALWAYS
  override the equivalent lock. The flags are set by default, so you will
  have to clear them before your locks work.

  The join lock for a channel is a normal @lock on the channel object.
  The transmit lock for a channel is a use @lock on the channel object.
  The receive lock for a channel is an enter @lock on the channel object.
  The description of a channel is the @desc of the channel object.

  If the channel object has @speechmod or @saystring set, those settings
  will override the player settings.

  Related Topics: @comjoin, @comleave, @comoff, @comon, @ccreate, @create,
                  @cset, @speechmod, @saystring.

@CSET

  COMMAND: @cset/<option> <channel>[=<value>]

  Changes the way a channel behaves. <option> can be one of the
  following:

    public  - channel is listed in everyone's @clist.
    private - channel is hidden from the @clist.
    loud    - channel announces player connects/disconnects.
    mute    - shuts connects/disconnects off.
    quiet   - same as mute.
    spoof   - allows the comtitle to replace the player's name.
    anon    - same as spoof.
    nospoof - channel will append the player's name to the comtitle.
    header  - Changes the prefix text used to announce a channel emit to
              <value>. <value> may contain color.
    object  - Sets the channel object to <value>. You must create an object
              before associating a channel with it.
    log     - Sets the maximum number of channel messages to log.
              The channel must have an object.
    timestamp_logs - [0/1] Indicates if log messages are prepended with a
            - timestamp.   Channel must have an object and logging enabled.

  You can set a description for the channel by changing the description
  of the channel object. Also, the channel object's lock will be used
  to check to see if people should be able to join the channel or not.

  Examples:
    > @cset/public Public
    @cset: Channel Public placed on the public listings.
    > @cset/object Public=#5
    Channel Public is now using Garou Channel Object(#5) as channel object.

CHANOBJ()

  FUNCTION: chanobj(<channel name>)

  This function returns the channel object for the given <channel name>.  As
  with all comsys commands, <channel name> is case sensitive.  If the channel
  name matches a comsys channel with a channel object set, the dbref of the
  object is returned.  If the channel has no channel object, #-1 is returned.

  By default, the chanobj() function is restricted to wizards.
