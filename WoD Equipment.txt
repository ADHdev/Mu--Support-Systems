BASECONV()

  FUNCTION: baseconv(<number>, <input radix>, <output radix>)

  Converts <number>, which is in base <input radix> to base <output radix>.
  The bases can be between 2 (binary) and 64, inclusive.  Positive and
  negative numbers are supported except for bases 63 and base 64 where - is
  not available. When converting from base 64, + and / have place value 62 and
  63, respectively.

  Bases 36 and under use the following symbols:

    0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

  Bases over 36 use base64 url string:

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-_

PACK()

  FUNCTION: pack(<number>[,<radix>[,<baseconv>]])

  Returns the equivalent of the given number using the specified base.  The
  default radix is 64.  Bases greater than 10 will be more compact than the
  original number.  Bases less than 10 will be more expanded.

  By default, this conversion is compatible with the codes used in Myrddin's
  popular Bulletin Board, and they are also valid for an attribute name
  (except for the first letter).  This set is:

    0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz@$

  This set is not the same as Unix-to-Unix copy (uuencode).  Optionally, with
  boolean <baseconv>, the behavior changes to be compatible with baseconv().

  Examples:
    >think pack(629126998)
    bVxTM
    >think pack(629126998,16)
    257FB756
    >think pack(629126998,2)
    100101011111111011011101010110
    >think pack(-629126998)
    -bVxTM
